MAS Requires:
  - agents should have either conflicting goals or face complex coordination problems;
  - the variety of sensors and actuators should not be too limited;
  - communication and coordination mechanisms (cooperation, negotiation, team formation, arguing);
  - pursue of goals at the expense of another (non-linear decisions) without a fixed order of priority;

Objectives:
1. Modeling the (multi)-agent system:
      o definition of the problem: requirements and objectives;
      o specification of agent properties: sensors, actuators, environment, decision making behavior;
      o design choices regarding the architecture for the implementation of the agent system;
2. Advanced decision making: depending on the system, agents may consider deliberative behavior or
  advanced learning principles (e.g. reinforcement learning or incremental learning);
3. Comparative analysis (very important): thorough analysis of the behavior of the agents for each
  implemented approach (detailed experiments, tables, graphs, etc.). Discussion of the suitability of
  the different approaches to address the target problem in accordance with the gathered results
  
The project will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
  - Clear and complete description of the problem that is being addressed;
  - Conceptual correction of the simulation environment and agent behavior;
  - Suitability and correctness of any embedded mechanisms of emotions, team-work, learning, etc.;
  - Selected approach and architectural principles to address the problem;
  - Intelligent, emergent agent behavior;
  - Adequacy and completion of the undertaken experimental analyzes (gathered results);
  - Relevance of conclusions inferred from empirical results;
  - Proper positioning and communication of the findings (report and accompanying video).
  
Document:
  1. problem definition, relevance and requirements
  2. proposal of an (multi)agent system and its adequacy to answer/study the problem
  3. properties of the agent(s) and environment in the proposed intelligent system 6-minute presentation in the labs after the Eastern break
Final:
  4. Full source code with a README on how to run the system using source code and an executable file
  5. Final report (maximum of 6 pages) according to the following template:
  http://www.aamas2017.org/submission-instructions_aamas2017.php
  6. A 3-minutes video demonstrating the agents or algorithms in-action, e.g.:
    - a. The emergence of some social phenomenon in a population;
    - b. The effect of learning new behavior (before and after learning);
    - c. The contagion of emotions in a population;
    - d. The “team-behavior” exhibited by some group of agents;
    - e. A comparison of the agents’ behavior between the several approaches
